# Club Los Paltos(CLP)

**Volunteer Project<br />Contact: Marcelo Piña or Julio Piña**

Club Los Paltos (CLP) is a fully responsive HTML prototype created with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Developed from the ground up, CLP handles 65% of its spanish content through multiple object arrays. These arrays process data by passing values into specific conditions and functions, which dynamically update the designated HTML elements with new innerHTML content. The prototype advances the project by incorporating a reservation center powered by Google's latest scheduling tool. However, reservations made through this prototype will not be officially registered with Club Los Paltos.
